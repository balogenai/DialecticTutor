# Dialectic Tutor ðŸ§ 

Dialectic Tutor is an interactive AI-powered educational tool designed to help children (ages 8â€“13) learn through guided conversations. Using the Socratic method, the tutor encourages reflection, asks thoughtful questions, and helps students arrive at answers on their own.

## Features

- **Socratic Method**: Encourages learning through guided questions and reflection.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly web app for interactive conversations.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Easily modify the tutor's behavior and tone via prompt templates.
- **Memory Tracking**: Maintains conversation history for context-aware responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/signup/)
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dialectic-tutor.git
   cd dialectic-tutor
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv_dialectic_tutor
   source venv_dialectic_tutor/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_dialectic_tutor\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

### Running the App

To launch the Streamlit app, run:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open in your default web browser. You can interact with the tutor by typing your questions or topics into the chat input.
